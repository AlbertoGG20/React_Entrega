# Ruta del Agua

This project is about the Water Route located in Telde. 

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React have been used for this page.

This project was created based on the template I designed in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/tZQuPDlYi8NQtL4jCq5zko/Untitled?page-id=0%3A1&type=design&node-id=136-2&viewport=-1039%2C147%2C0.52&t=776CFfabPegp1Dn5-1&scaling=min-zoom ).

Some inspirations for the page were:

- The Louvre Museum's page: [Louvre](https://www.louvre.fr/es)
- The page of a Vercel employee,  [Rauno]( https://rauno.me/)

Other websites that have given me some ideas, even though I haven't specifically considered them:
- [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/websites/).
- [ZARA](https://www.zara.com/es/)
